The application source code is held in the 'src' directory and there is a workflows Makefile called Makefile.das

Dynamic Verification - Makefile.das
-----------------------------------
make -f Makefile.das gen-ut
    => Uses GNATtest to generate (or update existing) test cases in verification/gnatdas/gnatdas_tests.
    => Additions to these *-test_data-tests.adb files, will be protected as long as they are
    => outside the areas which will be overwritteby regeneration.

make -f Makefile.das build-ut
    => Builds the *-test_data-tests.adb files and their dependencies into obj\gnattest

make -f Makefile.das run-ut
    => Executes the executable written to obj\gnattes by the previous workflow

make -f Makefile.das cov-ut
    => The 'gen-ut' workflow has produced a Makefile in /obj/gnattest which will perform coverage analysis
    => on the units under test. HTML and XML reports into verification/gnatdas/mcdc_results
